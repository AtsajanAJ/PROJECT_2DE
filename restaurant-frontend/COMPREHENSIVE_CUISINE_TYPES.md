## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Cuisine Matching Logic
```java
// Special cases for common cuisine types (comprehensive mapping)
if (!cuisineMatch) {
    // Japanese cuisine variations
    if ((searchCuisine.equals("japanese") && (restaurantCuisine.contains("ramen") || restaurantCuisine.contains("sushi") || restaurantCuisine.contains("japanese"))) ||
        (searchCuisine.equals("ramen") && restaurantCuisine.contains("japanese")) ||
        (searchCuisine.equals("sushi") && restaurantCuisine.contains("japanese"))) {
        System.out.println("✅ Japanese cuisine match found!");
        cuisineMatch = true;
    }
    
    // Thai cuisine variations
    else if (searchCuisine.equals("thai") && restaurantCuisine.contains("thai")) {
        System.out.println("✅ Thai cuisine match found!");
        cuisineMatch = true;
    }
    
    // Fast food variations
    else if ((searchCuisine.equals("fast food") || searchCuisine.equals("fastfood")) && restaurantCuisine.contains("fast")) {
        System.out.println("✅ Fast food match found!");
        cuisineMatch = true;
    }
    
    // Grilled pork variations
    else if ((searchCuisine.equals("grilled pork") || searchCuisine.equals("grilledpork")) && restaurantCuisine.contains("grilled")) {
        System.out.println("✅ Grilled pork match found!");
        cuisineMatch = true;
    }
    
    // ... (and 20 more cuisine types)
}
```

### Comprehensive Mapping Examples
```java
// Direct matches
"burger" → finds restaurants with "burger" in cuisine type
"pizza" → finds restaurants with "pizza" in cuisine type
"seafood" → finds restaurants with "seafood" in cuisine type

// Variations and synonyms
"japanese" → finds "ramen", "sushi", "japanese" restaurants
"grilled pork" → finds restaurants with "grilled" in cuisine type
"bubble milk tea" → finds restaurants with "bubble" in cuisine type
"vegetarian jay" → finds restaurants with "vegetarian" in cuisine type
"clean food salad" → finds restaurants with "clean" in cuisine type
```

## 🚀 Testing the Complete Cuisine Types
